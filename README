# Chess Conducto Pipeline
A pipeline that'll cobble together some data about my lichess games.

## Python venv
I use the venv python module to make venvs. On ubuntu there are sometimes
weird issues where python complains that the `ensurepip` library is missing.
You can run `apt install python3.7-venv` to install that missing lib.
